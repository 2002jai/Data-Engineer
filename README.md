# Data-Engineer
A comprehensive GitHub repository covering data engineering topics for data science, including ingestion, processing, storage, transformation, visualization, cloud deployment, and best practices.


Description:
This GitHub repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of resources, code examples, and projects for Data Engineers working in the field of Data Science. It covers a wide range of topics related to data engineering, including data ingestion, processing, storage, transformation, and analysis. The repository is designed to help data engineers gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience in building robust and scalable data pipelines for data science projects.
